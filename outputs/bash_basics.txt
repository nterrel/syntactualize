Hi there!
Bash separates commands by newlines or semicolons.

count=5, name=Nick
Example: data_001.txt
MAYBE_UNSET (defaulted) = default_value

Double quotes expand: name=Nick
Single quotes are literal: $name stays $name
Always quote: '/tmp/my folder'

Today is 2026-01-06

arr[0]=One
All elements (quoted) -> preserves spaces:
  - One
  - Two words
  - Three

Array length: 3

dict[One]=1
Keys (unordered):
  One => 1
  Three => 3
  Two => 2

7 + 3 = 10

10 is greater than 5
'hello' matches glob h*

bash is a directory

i is currently: 1
i is currently: 2
i is currently: 3
i is currently: 4
i is currently: 5

item=alpha
item=beta
item=gamma

Reading lines safely:
  -> line1
  -> line two
  -> line3

Hi, Nick!
Hi, world!

git is installed

This goes to stdout
tmpfile contents:
writing a line
appending a line

Here-doc block:
- Useful for config snippets, templates, and long text.
- Quoted delimiter (<<'EOF') prevents expansion of $vars and $(commands).

Script name: ./bash/basics.sh
Number of args: 0
Args (one per line):

num=1

In subshell: x=inside
Outside: x=outside

Done.
